## Variants in the spike mutations

The Delta Variant has additional spike mutations at positions `S:T19R`, `S:R158G`, `S:T478K`, and `S:D950N`. Additionally, it has a deletion at positions `S:E156-` and `S:F157-`. Many sequences in `Variant21A(Delta)` also have a deletion at positions `ORF8:D119- and ORF8:F120-.`.

These sequences therefore have mutations in the N-terminal domain, receptor binding domain (RBD), and furin cleavage site of the spike protein, which could impact a variety of antibodies. In order to determine how transmissble Delta is, one way of doing so is looking at the furin cleavage site of the spike protein, which could impact a variety of antibodies.

## Sub lineages of Delta 

The sub-lineages contained lineage defining spike mutations: ```B.1.617.1, S: T95I, G142D, E154K, L452R,
E484Q, D614G, P681R, Q1071H, B.1.617.2 S: T19R, G142D, 156del, 157del, R158G, L452R,
T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N, and B.1.617.3 S: T19R, L452R, E484Q, D614G, P681R```. 

## Origins 

The Pango lineage `B.1.617` includes both `Variant21B(Kappa)` and its sister lineage `Variant21A(Delta)`. `B.1.617` was first detected in late 2020 in India, and has appeared to expand rapidly. Accumulating evidence suggests that B.1.617 lineage variants are more transmissible and perhaps more lethal than B.1.1.7 (a.k.a. alpha variant), which had been a dominant strain in Indian population before the arrival of second wave.

## Growth in the US

Data from `Helix2` on nearly 20,000 samples sequenced since April suggest that the Delta variant is spreading faster in US counties where less than 30% of residents have been fully vaccinated, compared to the counties with vaccination rates above that threshold.
